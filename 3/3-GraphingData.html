            1. restart zhs bc it messes up for some reason: PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:${PATH}
            2. Confirm this works using ls
            3. cd to the file you want to open 
            4. npx http-server in the file 
            5. Make sure CORS is enabled with --cors 
            6. Open the http server 
            7. It should work lol if it doesn't search it up

            // which has a function called split. This allows you to take any text 
            // and split it up into different elements of the array.

            // in this case, we don't need the first "year" row for parsing the data
            // we can easily remove a row with Array.prototype.slice() --> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice
            // This makes a copy of the array, but you get to choose what portion of the array 
            // is copied. In this case, we want to copy from index 1 (the second element) to the end. 
            // this is done on line 45 with .slice(1)

            // the next step is splitting each of the cvs rows into separate fields 
            // for this case, we only need the year and the difference from the mean temperature
