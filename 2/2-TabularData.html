        <!-- YOU NEED A LOCAL SERVER IN ORDER TO RUN THIS.
        TUTORIAL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjWbUK2HdCo&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zu_uqEA6NqhLzKLACwU74X&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain -->

        <!-- How to run your own server: 
        1. restart zhs bc it messes up for some reason: PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:${PATH}
        2. Confirm this works using ls
        3. cd to the file you want to open 
        4. npx http-server in the file 
        5. Make sure CORS is enabled with --cors 
        6. Open the http server 
        7. It should work lol if it doesn't search it up
        -->

            // console.log(data); // The CSV data that is trandformed into text is logged in the console


            // now we are going to parse the data. There are ways to parse data 
            // non-manually through things like p5, but for this case we are

            table.forEach (elt => { // => is a higher JS function

            // Everytime to have a line of text in JavaScript, it is a string object 
            // which has a function called split. This allows you to take any text 
            // and split it up into different elements of the array.

            // in this case, we don't need the first "year" row for parsing the data
            // we can easily remove a row with Array.prototype.slice() --> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice
            // This makes a copy of the array, but you get to choose what portion of the array 
            // is copied. In this case, we want to copy from index 1 (the second element) to the end. 
            // this is done on line 45 with .slice(1)

            // the next step is splitting each of the cvs rows into separate fields 
            // for this case, we only need the year and the difference from the mean temperature
            // this is done from line 46
